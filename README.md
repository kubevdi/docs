# KubeVDI Documentation

This repository is for general purpose documentation and architectural discussions / documents and images.

At the moment it has one big section: talk about the prototype, lessons learned, and how to do it better.

## Prototype

There is already a version v0.1.0 out there which is working and provides remote desktops to end users. However, the goal of this prototype was different and should be outlined here.

**NOTE:** the source code of v0.1.0 is not available as this work cannot be open sourced due to company policies. This is one of the reasons why we need to start from scratch again (and it is probably a good idea).

Nothing says more than a picture:
